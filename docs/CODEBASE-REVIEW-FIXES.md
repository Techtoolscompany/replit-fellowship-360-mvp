# Fellowship 360 - Codebase Review & Fixes Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Code Review  
**Status:** Critical fixes applied, some items remain

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. Removed Unused Drizzle ORM System
**Problem:** Project had complete Drizzle ORM setup that was never used

**Actions Taken:**
- ‚ùå Deleted `drizzle.config.ts`
- ‚ùå Deleted `shared/schema.ts` (140+ lines)
- ‚ùå Deleted `apps/web/src/lib/database/schema.ts`
- ‚ùå Removed dependencies: `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-zod`, `drizzle-kit`
- ‚ùå Removed `db:push` script from package.json

**Impact:** 
- Eliminated 3 dependencies
- Removed 150+ lines of dead code
- Clearer architecture (Supabase-only)

---

### 2. Removed Duplicate Auth System
**Problem:** Two competing authentication systems

**Actions Taken:**
- ‚ùå Deleted `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` (80 lines of unused JWT auth)
- ‚ùå Deleted `/api/auth/login` route
- ‚ùå Deleted `/api/auth/register` route
- ‚úÖ Kept Supabase auth context at `apps/web/src/lib/auth/context.tsx`

**Impact:**
- Single source of truth for authentication
- Simpler, more maintainable codebase

---

### 3. Fixed Authentication System
**Problem:** Frontend used Supabase auth but API routes expected JWT tokens

**Actions Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Created `apps/web/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` for server-side Supabase client
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/contacts/route.ts` to use Supabase auth
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/churches/route.ts` to use Supabase auth
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/twilio/voice-handler/route.ts` (uses service role for webhooks)
- ‚úÖ Installed `@supabase/ssr` for proper Next.js 15 support

**New Pattern:**
```typescript
// All authenticated API routes now use:
const supabase = await createClient()
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

**Impact:**
- Auth system now works end-to-end
- Consistent authentication across frontend and backend
- Ready for RLS policies

---

### 4. Created Environment Variables Template
**Actions Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` with all required variables

**Required Variables:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

**Impact:**
- Clear documentation of configuration requirements
- New developers know what to set up

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Not Set
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING - Database is currently wide open

**Problem:**
- All API routes now use Supabase client
- But no RLS policies are defined in Supabase
- Anyone with a valid session can access any data

**Required Actions:**
You need to add RLS policies in your Supabase dashboard. Here are the essential policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE churches ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE contacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Churches: Users can only see their own church (or all if AGENCY)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their church"
  ON churches FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM users 
      WHERE church_id = churches.id 
      OR role = 'AGENCY'
    )
  );

-- Users: Can only see users in their church
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their church members"
  ON users FOR SELECT
  USING (
    church_id IN (
      SELECT church_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR 
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'AGENCY'
  );

-- Contacts: Can only see contacts in their church
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their church contacts"
  ON contacts FOR SELECT
  USING (
    church_id IN (
      SELECT church_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR 
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'AGENCY'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert contacts in their church"
  ON contacts FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    church_id IN (
      SELECT church_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their church contacts"
  ON contacts FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    church_id IN (
      SELECT church_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Priority:** üö® IMMEDIATE

---

### 2. User Migration to Supabase Auth Required
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING - Users can't log in yet

**Problem:**
- Old system stored users with passwords in `users` table
- New system expects users in Supabase `auth.users` table
- Current user records won't work with new auth

**Required Actions:**
1. Create users in Supabase Auth (via dashboard or API)
2. Link Supabase auth.users to your users table
3. Update `users` table to reference Supabase auth user IDs

**Migration Script Needed:**
```typescript
// For each existing user:
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: user.email,
  password: 'temporary_password', // They'll need to reset
  email_confirm: true,
  user_metadata: {
    first_name: user.firstName,
    last_name: user.lastName,
    role: user.role,
    church_id: user.churchId
  }
})
```

**Priority:** üö® IMMEDIATE

---

### 3. Duplicate Sidebar Components
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality Issue

**Problem:**
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` (255 lines) - NOT USED
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/dashboard-with-collapsible-sidebar.tsx` (294 lines) - ACTIVELY USED

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
rm apps/web/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx
```

**Priority:** üìã Medium (doesn't break anything, but confusing)

---

### 4. TypeScript Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Warning

**Problem:**
`tsconfig.json` references wrong paths:
```json
"include": ["client/src/**/*", "shared/**/*", "server/**/*"]
```

But actual structure is: `apps/web/src/**/*`

**Fix:**
```json
{
  "include": ["apps/web/src/**/*"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./apps/web/src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Priority:** üìã Medium

---

### 5. Deprecated Tailwind Plugin
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Warning

**Problem:**
`apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` uses deprecated `@tailwindcss/line-clamp`

**Fix:**
Remove from plugins array (line 111):
```typescript
plugins: [
  require("tailwindcss-animate"), 
  require("@tailwindcss/typography")
  // Remove: require("@tailwindcss/line-clamp")
],
```

**Priority:** üìã Low (works but deprecated)

---

### 6. Missing API Security Hardening
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Enhancement

**Current Gaps:**
- ‚ùå No rate limiting on any endpoints
- ‚ùå No CSRF protection
- ‚ùå No request validation middleware
- ‚ùå Console logs expose sensitive data

**Recommended Additions:**
1. Add rate limiting middleware (e.g., `@upstash/ratelimit`)
2. Add request logging (sanitized)
3. Add input sanitization
4. Remove console.logs in production

**Priority:** üìã Medium (once app is working)

---

### 7. Missing Twilio Process Speech Route
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete Feature

**Problem:**
`/api/twilio/voice-handler` references `/api/twilio/process-speech` which doesn't exist or wasn't updated

**Action Needed:**
Update or create `apps/web/src/app/api/twilio/process-speech/route.ts` with Supabase auth

**Priority:** üìã Medium (if using Grace AI features)

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS CHECKLIST

### Immediate (Required for App to Work)
- [ ] **Set up RLS policies in Supabase dashboard**
- [ ] **Migrate existing users to Supabase Auth**
- [ ] **Create `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill in values**
- [ ] **Test authentication flow end-to-end**

### High Priority (Code Quality)
- [ ] Remove duplicate sidebar component
- [ ] Fix TypeScript configuration paths
- [ ] Update `process-speech` Twilio route

### Medium Priority (Improvements)
- [ ] Remove deprecated Tailwind plugin
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Add proper error logging (not console.log)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Add comprehensive API tests
- [ ] Document all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add API response caching where appropriate

---

## üéØ TESTING CHECKLIST

Once RLS and user migration are complete, test:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] User can sign in via Supabase
   - [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
   - [ ] User can sign out

2. **API Routes**
   - [ ] GET /api/contacts returns user's church contacts
   - [ ] POST /api/contacts creates new contact
   - [ ] GET /api/churches returns appropriate churches
   - [ ] Unauthorized requests return 401
   - [ ] Cross-church access is denied

3. **Permissions**
   - [ ] STAFF can only see their church
   - [ ] ADMIN can manage their church
   - [ ] AGENCY can see all churches

---

## üìö USEFUL COMMANDS

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
cd apps/web && npm run lint

# Test Supabase connection (create this script)
node scripts/test-supabase-connection.js
```
