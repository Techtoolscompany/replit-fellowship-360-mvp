Fellowship 360 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Goals and Background Context
Goals
To successfully offload at least 30% of daily administrative tasks for our initial cohort of partner churches.

To provide a solution that is culturally aligned with the relational, community-centric nature of church operations.

To create a uniquely effective and supportive alternative to self-managed tools through a combination of an AI-first platform and expert partnership.

To build a foundational CRM and AI Assistant (Grace) that can be expanded into a full ecosystem of ministry tools.

Background Context
Many churches, particularly those with small teams, face a significant capacity gap in managing day-to-day administration. This leads to staff burnout and missed opportunities for member engagement. Existing software solutions often worsen this problem by imposing rigid, corporate-style workflows that are culturally misaligned with church needs. Fellowship 360 aims to solve this by providing a smart, AI-powered assistant (Grace) integrated into a modern CRM, all delivered through a supportive, hands-on partnership model.
